# Tetris #

This is a Tetris game coded in JavaScript.

Open **Tetris.html** with a browser and start the game.

Use **↑  ↓  ←  →  and D** key to control the game.

And **D** key is used for letting the blocks fall down directly.

Enjoy yourself!

**PS.**

This project is my first self-design project in github, although it's just a little.

I hope the game would encourage me when I'm down in coding work.
